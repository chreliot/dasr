      <description>This event is in the 2018–2019 Mathematics Seminar series.
Abstract: Love it or hate it, many people believe that mathematics gives humans access to a kind of truth that is more absolute and universal than other disciplines. If this claim is true, we must ask: what makes the origins and processes of mathematics special and how can our messy, biological brains connect to the absolute? If the claim is false, then what becomes of truth in mathematics?</description>

      <description>Category A. Philosophy of Science PHI 152 (QR) Scientific Reasoning There may or may not be a Scientific Method. But there are definitely scientific methods. What are they? How and why do they work? And when science fails, what are some ways it fails? We will learn, use, and debate ideas about how to think scientifically. And we will observe science succeeding and failing in case-studies from current research and the history of science.</description>

      <description>Students in the course “Coding Evolution of Cooperation” (Philosophy 51 C) have been developing a simulator for Iterated Prisoner&amp;rsquo;s Dilemma games.
If the rewards for &amp;ldquo;cheating&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;cooperating&amp;rdquo; in a Prisoner&amp;rsquo;s Dilemma situation have a certain structure, then agents have an incentive to cooperate over the long term, even though it is always rational to cheat in a single interaction. This structure of rewards is extremely common in the natural world, from the interaction of groupers and wrasse fish to mutual cooperation in human societies.</description>
